# Next.js + TailwindCSS + Jest

### How to Use

In your terminal, run the following command:

```bash
yarn dev
```

or

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Running Tests

```bash
pnpm test
```

## Tasks:

#### Task 1: Real-time search feature

- [x] Develop a simple Next.js application (with Typescript) that features real-time search functionality within a static list of objects.
- [x] Use a static JSON file to mock the object dataset.
- [x] Provide commentary on how your implementation can be improved.
- [x] Includes tests to verify that your solution works.

#### Task 2: Image optimization and lazy loading

- [x] Develop a simple photo gallery Next.js application (with TypeScript) that implements image optimization and lazy loading techniques.
- [x] Implement a data modelâ€”using types, interfacesâ€”representing photos, including
      metadata like URLs and captions.
- [x] Implement API routes to fetch photo data from a datasource or a mock.
- [x] Provide commentary on how your implementation can be improved.
- [x] Include tests to verify that your solution works correctly under concurrent usage.

#### Task 3: (Optional) Open-ended challenge

- [ ] Propose and solve a programming challenge that you believe showcases your ingenuity and
      deep understanding of NextJS and Typescript. This could involve algorithms, system design,
      tool development, or any area you excel in.
