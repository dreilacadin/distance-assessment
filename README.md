## Tasks:

#### Task 1: Real-time search feature
- [ ] Develop a simple Next.js application (with Typescript) that features real-time search functionality within a static list of objects.
- [ ] Use a static JSON file to mock the object dataset.
- [ ] Provide commentary on how your implementation can be improved.
- [ ] Includes tests to verify that your solution works.

#### Task 2: Image optimization and lazy loading
- [ ] Develop a simple photo gallery Next.js application (with TypeScript) that implements image optimization and lazy loading techniques.
- [ ] Implement a data model—using types, interfaces—representing photos, including
metadata like URLs and captions.
- [ ] Implement API routes to fetch photo data from a datasource or a mock.
- [ ] Provide commentary on how your implementation can be improved.
- [ ] Include tests to verify that your solution works correctly under concurrent usage.

#### Task 3: (Optional) Open-ended challenge
- [ ] Propose and solve a programming challenge that you believe showcases your ingenuity and
deep understanding of NextJS and Typescript. This could involve algorithms, system design,
tool development, or any area you excel in.
